My name is Iosif (aka Joseph).
I am a Research Fellow at the <a href='https://www.sutd.edu.sg/'>SUTD</a> working with <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/antoniosvarvitsiotis/'>Antonios Varvitsiotis</a> and <a href='https://georgiospiliouras.com/'>Georgios Piliouras</a>.
My research lies at the intersection of algorithmic game theory and nonconvex optimization, with a primary focus on learning and equilibration in strategic multi-agent environments.

<h2>Research Overview</h2>

Multi-agent problems often admit a structural viewpoint that gives rise to nonconvex optimization formulations.
For example:
<ul>
 <li>Extensive-form games are polynomial games in behavioral strategies.</li>
 <li>ML architectures such as GAN training can exhibit hidden-monotone structures.</li>
</ul> 

My research develops optimization-based methods for certifying the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria, as well as the convergence rates of gradient-based algorithms in these settings. 
I further develop SDP-based frameworks for identifying and steering learning behavior in multi-agent systems, even when data are scarce or expensive to acquire. 
More recently, I have been working on exploiting an analogous structure in quantum ML, in particular on the development of provable approximation schemes for training PQCs.
