I am actively involved in graduate-level teaching in optimization, games, and learning. In January 2025, I was a co-facilitator for <i>Optimization for Data Science</i> (with <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/antoniosvarvitsiotis/'>Antonios Varvitsiotis</a>). 
In September 2025, I served as a teaching fellow for <i>Special Topics in Games, Learning, and Optimization</i> (with <a href='https://anasbarakat.github.io/'>Anas Barakat</a> and <a href='https://jlazarsfeld.github.io/'>John Lazarsfeld</a>), for which we developed <a href='https://learning-in-games.github.io/'>a complete course website</a>. 
My teaching emphasizes mathematical rigor, conceptual clarity, and the unifying role of optimization in learning and strategic interaction.
